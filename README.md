# Newsweek Home Page Replica

> This project is a clone of Newsweek home page. It makes use of Bootstrap, float, flex and grid CSS display positioning styles. This was completed as part of the Microverse remote software developement curriculum using the solo programming approach. Additionally a basic JavaScript method used to make navbar dynamic depends on the scroll action. Content of the webpage is copied from [that](https://www.newsweek.com/) original page.
